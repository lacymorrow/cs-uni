1. I added a PoisonPotion object which takes away a life if used. Also is the beginning of a more in-depth story as you are pushed through a trapdoor by the king.

2. Using inheritance we are able to create more functions within the same game without changing the original game. You can still use the old version without any changes.

3. I would add another room and another item "lockedDoor". When one unlocks the door the dragon would come out and "shoot fire", taking a life and giving the user the option to escape backwards or dodge forwards.

4. I would change the pick up item command to "obtain" which would store a list of items in the player class. Invoking the "quaff" command would check if the user has an item before using it.
